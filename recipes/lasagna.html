    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h5>Meat Sauce</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Set the oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to <strong>375°F (190°C)</strong>
                <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium-low heat and sauté onion and garlic until onions are translucent about <em>3 minutes.</em>
                <li>Turn heat to medium-high, add beef and sausage to the pan. Break the meat up into smaller pieces and cook until no traces of pink remain, about <em>5 minutes.</em> Season meat with 1 ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper.
                <li>Add tomato paste and stir until combined, cook for <em>1 minute</em>. Stir in crushed tomatoes and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally for <em>30 minutes</em>. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as desired. 
            </ol>
        <h5>Lasagna</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until al dente, about <em>8 minutes</em>. Carefully remove the lasagna noodles and transfer them to a sheet pan lined with clean kitchen towels. Place them in a single layer, to keep them from sticking together. Set aside until ready to use.
                <li>In a medium-sized bowl whisk together eggs, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and chopped parsley.
                <li>Reserve about 1 cup of meat sauce and 1 cup of grated mozzarella cheese for topping the lasagna. Lightly coat a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish with oil. Add just enough sauce to lightly cover the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking.
                <li>Layer 3 to 4 sheets of lasagna, top with ⅓ of ricotta cheese mixture, ⅓ meat sauce, and ⅓ of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat for 2 more layers. On the top layer pour the reserved meat sauce and cover evenly with the reserved mozzarella cheese.
                <li>Line a sheet tray with foil and place the lasagna tray on top. Loosely cover with foil, making sure not to touch the top with the cheese. Bake for <em>30 minutes</em>, then remove the foil. Bake until the cheese is hot and bubbly on top, about <em>15 minutes</em>. The lasagna can be brolied for a few minutes right before removing from the oven for an extra browned crust.
                <li>Before slicing, allow the lasagna to rest for <em>15 minutes</em>.
